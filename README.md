# Fract'ol Project

## Overview
**Fract'ol** is a unique project at 42 Seoul, blending computer graphics and mathematics to create captivating fractal images. Using MiniLibX, students embark on a journey to render the intricate designs of fractals.

## Features

- **Fractal Rendering**: Explore the mathematical beauty of the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
- **Infinite Zooming**: Dive into the fractals with almost limitless zooming capabilities.
- **Dynamic Julia Sets**: Generate various Julia sets by adjusting parameters.
- **Command Line Control**: Use command line arguments to select fractal types.
- **Colorful Visuals**: Employ a range of colors to highlight fractal depths and experiment with psychedelic effects.
- **Smooth Window Management**: Ensure seamless handling of window interactions.
- **User-Friendly Interactions**: Implement graceful exit strategies via the ESC key or window's close button.

## Technical Requirements

- **Language**: All code must be written in C.
- **Library Use**: Mandatory use of MiniLibX for graphics rendering.
- **No Global Variables**: Adherence to proper variable scoping is essential.
- **Memory Management**: Vigilant handling of memory allocations to prevent leaks.
- **Makefile Rules**: Include $(NAME), all, clean, fclean, and re rules in your Makefile.

## Bonus Features

- **Extra Fractals**: Challenge yourself by adding more fractal types.
- **Mouse-Centric Zoom**: Implement zooming relative to the mouse position.
- **Navigational Controls**: Allow view adjustments using the arrow keys.
- **Color Dynamics**: Create a shifting color spectrum within the fractals.
